Hey! I graduated from the MCO PhD program, studying vision evoked behavior and decision making in larval zebrafish. I'm currently pursuing postdoctoral research in applying AI methods to protein sequence annotation. Excited to interact with all of you and learn together! Always happy to chat about literally anything, so feel free to reach out!
